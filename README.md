# Health and Longevity Knowledge Base

**Live Application URL:** (https://kareltestspecial.github.io/LFH/index.html)

This project is a simple web-based application that presents a comprehensive, hierarchical overview of topics related to health and longevity. The information is displayed in an interactive, collapsible accordion format, allowing users to explore the various subjects and their relationships.

## Usage

To use the application, open the `index.html` file in a web browser or visit the live URL above. The main page displays the health and longevity topics in a nested accordion.

-   **Expand/Collapse:** Click on a topic's bar to expand or collapse its sub-topics.
-   **View Topic Details / Search:**
    -   Click on the `>` button on the right side of any topic to trigger the search/navigation.
    -   Alternatively, if a topic has no sub-topics, clicking anywhere on its bar will also trigger the search/navigation.
    -   If the topic has a dedicated content page, you will be navigated to it.
    -   If not, a DuckDuckGo search for the topic (including its full hierarchical path) will be opened in a new tab.

## Project Structure

The project is composed of the following files:

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file for the accordion view.
-   `script.js`: The JavaScript file that dynamically builds the accordion from `data.json`.
-   `style.css`: The stylesheet for the application.
-   `data.json`: The JSON file containing the hierarchical data for the accordion. This file is generated by `parse_outline.py`.
-   `LFHoutline.txt`: The source text file for the content. The hierarchy is defined by indentation.
-   `parse_outline.py`: A Python script that parses `LFHoutline.txt` and generates `data.json`.
-   `topic.html`: The HTML template for individual topic pages.
-   `topic.js`: The JavaScript file that populates the topic pages with content.
-   `content-manifest.json`: A list of topics that have dedicated content pages.

## Updating the Content

The content of the accordion is sourced from the `LFHoutline.txt` file. To add, remove, or modify topics, follow these steps:

1.  **Edit the outline:** Open `LFHoutline.txt` and make your desired changes. The hierarchy is determined by indentation, with each level of indentation representing a deeper level in the accordion.
2.  **Regenerate the data file:** Run the `parse_outline.py` script to update the `data.json` file.

    ```bash
    python parse_outline.py
    ```

This will update the data that is displayed on the website.

## Technology Stack

-   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-   **Data Processing:** Python

## Note on AI Generation

The content outline and the code for this project were generated with the assistance of AI.
